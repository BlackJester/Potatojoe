my latest gamejam game. It was made in a group of 3 people. I was responsible for almost all the coding. It was the first project coding for the second programmer, so i had to clean up most of his code during the 48 hour jam. The game is about a airship, where everybody is stuck in a neverending loop and the player has to manipulate the npc in their loops to achieve his endgoal.
